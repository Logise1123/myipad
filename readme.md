# 📱 Web-based iPad-style Apps (HTML)

This repository contains all the web apps for a custom iPad-style project built in HTML. The apps are meant to be accessed from inside the project’s **internal App Store** — a launcher that looks like an App Store and opens each app in a fullscreen view, just like a real tablet.

## 🧩 How it works

- There's a main "iPad" project (not in this repo) that looks and feels like a tablet.
- Inside it, there’s a **App Store** where users can browse and install apps.
- All the apps in this repo are part of that store, and open in fullscreen via HTML files.

## 📦 Included Apps

- `Notes`: A simple and clean notes app.  
- `Weather`: Check the weather in your current location.  
- `Calculator`: A basic + scientific calculator.  
- `Photos`: View and relive your saved pictures.

## 🚀 How to use

1. Open the main iPad project in a browser.
2. Go to the built-in App Store inside it.
3. Select and launch any app — it will load from this repository.
4. All apps are lightweight and mobile-friendly.
